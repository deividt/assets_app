## assets_app

Tree View Application that shows companies Assets.

This is part of a technical [challenge](https://github.com/tractian/challenges/blob/main/mobile/README.md) for the
[Tractian](https://tractian.com/) company.

### To Improve:

- Improve error handling when retrieving data from the API;
- Improve loading and error screens;
- Organize better the project structure and its folders inside each feature;
- Improve performance of the filter/tree (it is a little bit slow when there is a large amount of data);
- Add more unit tests;
- Add a better design system with tokens for colors, sizes and styles;

### Missing:

- Accessibility;
- Multi-language support;
- Light/Dark modes;

### Useful commands:

- Generates code, assets, or other build artifacts: `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
- Generates localization files: `dart run intl_utils:generate`
- Run unit tests: `flutter test`
